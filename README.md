A node array helper that replicates some of the functionality of the [Yii2 ArrayHelper](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-helpers-arrayhelper.html) for the corresponding JavaScript data types( for example `getColumn()` or `map()`). Some of the methods of the Yii2 ArrayHelper are missing, some additional methods have been added. 

Documentation is forthcoming, currently refer to the tests for examples and to the code comments for general usage.
